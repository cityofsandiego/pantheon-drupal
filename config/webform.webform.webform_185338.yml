Execution of an agreement and issuance of a purchase order can take up to 60 days after receipt by the City of all required documentation.</p>\n\n<p>11. REIMBURSEMENT: Each Organization awarded funding will only be paid on a reimbursement basis and only once an agreement is fully executed and the purchase order issued. Expenses must be incurred by the Organization during the FY2020 agreement period (July 1, 2019 through June 30, 2020) before the City will reimburse.</p>\n\n<p>12. TERMS AND CONDITIONS: Each Organization awarded funding is required to comply with the terms and conditions of the agreement including but not limited to: Council Policy 100-04 (Americans with Disabilities Act/City Contractors), Equal Opportunity (Non-Discrimination Clause), Equal Benefits Ordinance, Council Policy 100-07 (Drug Free Work Place), Living Wage Ordinance and Prevailing Wage Ordinance.</p>\n\n<p>13. RESOLUTION: If funding is awarded, the Organization must have a formal resolution of its Board of Directors approving the agreement with the City of San Diego. The resolution shall state that the Board of Directors understands and will comply with the terms and conditions of the agreement, including maintaining the required insurance coverage and performing the Scope of Services within the amount of the allocated budget. This resolution must be signed by the Board President or designated officer.</p>\n\n<p>14. INSURANCE: Each Organization awarded funding is required to provide proof of specified insurance coverage at required amounts and with required endorsements for Commercial General Liability Insurance, Automobile Liability Insurance and Workers Compensation Insurance. It is not necessary to have the required insurance coverage at the time of the RFQ or RFP responses, but it is highly recommended to include the proportional cost of insurance in the anticipated Program/Project budget. Generally, Organizations must maintain Commercial General Liability (CGL) and automobile insurance providing minimum liability coverage of $1 million per occurrence and $2 million aggregate and shall provide proof/endorsements to the City that such insurance coverage is primary and non-contributory and for completed and ongoing operations and that the City is named as an additional insured. Organizations must also maintain $1 million workers compensation insurance coverage (even if no paid employees) and must provide an endorsement that the insurer waives the right of subrogation against the City.</p>\n\n<p>15. REPORTING: Each Organization awarded funding is required to deliver quarterly performance and financial reports and final performance and financial reports in a format provided by City staff along with other certifications and acknowledgements.</p>\n\n<p>16. REGISTRATIONS: Each Organization awarded funding is required to comply with all required state and federal registrations including but not limited to California Attorney General Registrar of Charitable Trusts, California Secretary of State Business Registry, System for Awards Management and Department of Industrial Relations DSLE Debarments. All registrations must be current during the agreement period.</p>\n\n<p>17. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: Organizations receiving funding must provide annual financial statements as noted below:</p>\n\n<p style='margin-left: 40px;'>• An Organization receiving funding of $10,000 or more must provide true, accurate and complete financial disclosure documentation evidencing the financial status of the Organization’s most recently concluded fiscal year within 90 days of the end of that fiscal year.<br>\n	&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style='margin-left: 40px;'>• An Organization receiving funding in the amount of $75,000 or more combined from City, County, State, or Federal Governments must submit true, accurate and complete financial disclosure documentation evidencing the financial status of the Organization’s most recently concluded fiscal year within 150 days of the end of that fiscal year prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and audited by an independent Certified Public Accountant, in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards.<br>\n	&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p style='margin-left: 40px;'>• An Organization receiving funding in the amount of $500,000 or more combined from City, County, State, or Federal Governments, or when that combined funding represents more than 10 percent of the Organization’s annual budget, must provide salary and wage ranges for each of its job classifications, including actual executive salaries and benefits packages applicable for the agreement period.</p>\n\n<p>It is highly recommended to include the proportional cost associated with the preparation, and auditing as applicable, of City-required financial statements by the RFQ/RFP.</p>\n\n<p>18. ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF CITY FUNDING: A credit line must be included in any printed, visual or recorded matter that credits the City for its support. The following is an example of a credit line that might be utilized: 'This project is funded in part by the City of San Diego.'<br>\n	<br>\n	19. PUBLIC INFORMATION: The applying Organization acknowledges that information submitted as part of their RFQ/RFP process may be subject to disclosure under the California Public Records Act.</p>\n"
