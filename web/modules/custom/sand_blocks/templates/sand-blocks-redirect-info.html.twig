Also, some of these as you can see call a function, also in the settings file, for complex redirect logic.</p>&#10      {% for key,value in redirects %}&#10          <div>&#10              <p><i class="icon-paper-plane"></i> <strong>From:</strong> {{ key }} <strong>To:</strong> {{ value }}</p>&#10          </div>&#10      {% endfor %}&#10  </div>&#10{% endif %}
